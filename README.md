# Gesture Based Smart Home Controller

Created a program that takes any video feed and turns it into a smart home controller. 
In this program it takes the video feed from an iPhone mounted on the ceiling.
Uses a fine tuned version of Googles Mediapipe along with a variety of image preprocessing methods to improve the gesture detection to 5 metres
